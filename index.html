        <section>
            <p>It is important to find a Mississippi tax attorney who specializes in tax law because it can be quite complex. Not all lawyers are familiar with the tax code and not all of them specialize in this area of the law, but someone who does specialize will be able to provide you with better service than someone who doesn’t work with the internal revenue service on tax-related legal issues. For example, a personal injury attorney may not be the best representative for you. Finding one that practices locally is also very important if you want to deal with them face-to-face on any issues that come up. Ask your friends or family members if they know anyone qualified. If no one knows of anyone, consider looking for information on local lawyers online. Make a list of all the lawyers you want to interview and then call them one by one until you find someone who can help you.</p>
            <p>Many tax lawyers will provide consultation services for free so it’s important not to cut this step short, because finding a lawyer with both IRS and United States Tax Court experience might take some time. Make sure you understand exactly how much their services will cost before signing up with any particular attorney for legal assistance; otherwise, your relationship may end poorly if you feel that they are charging too much or that they aren’t doing enough to help solve your problems. If you ever feel like an attorney is taking advantage of your situation in any way it is best to find another one. Most tax lawyers in this field work on a flat fee or hourly basis to resolve the matter with the IRS.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: 400; color: #6198cb">Consider the experience of your tax attorney with various tax law areas and United States Tax Court</h2>
            <p>Tax law is complex, and many people who are not a tax lawyer do not understand the intricacies of the tax code or tax related issues. They may end up with a substandard product or service that does more harm than good. Consider the experience of the tax attorney with various tax law cases. Try to find someone who has handled cases similar to your own. Make sure you get an estimate of how much it will cost ahead of time so you know what you can afford before making any commitments or agreeing on a price without understanding the full scope of the project at hand. Be wary if there is no written contract detailing all aspects of the work to be done. Also, if you have issues with the State Department of Revenue it may benefit you to find a local Mississippi attorney.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: 400; color: #6198cb">Ask to see a list of their past clients and testimonials</h2>
            <p>The first thing you need to know about lawyers is that there's a difference between those who specialize in tax law and those who don't. A non-tax lawyer will be more of an expert at the general practice of law and should probably handle your divorce, contract, or whatever other kind of legal issue you might have. When it comes to taxes, though, they're not going to be able to help you as much as tax attorneys will. Tax attorneys are experts in all aspects dealing with taxes from filing returns, audits, tax planning, and disputes with the IRS over your balance due. They're the ones who can tell you how best to claim deductions if your taxable income is too high. And if things go wrong – which they do – they're the ones most likely to know how to deal with it. You could also look up their credentials just to make sure that they are licensed to practice law.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: 400; color: #6198cb">Check for any disciplinary actions taken against the attorney by looking on the Mississippi Bar Association website</h2>
            <p>Tax law is a confusing and ever-changing area of the law. It’s not for amateurs, but if you need a qualified tax lawyer in Mississippi, there are some things to look out for before hiring one. The first thing to do when looking for a tax lawyer is to check with the Mississippi Bar Association website. Make sure they have no disciplinary actions against them by searching their name or bar number on this site. Another important thing to consider when looking for a tax lawyer in Mississippi is whether or not they specialize solely in taxes or they also represent clients in business and estates, trusts, and wills.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: 400; color: #6198cb">Make sure you are comfortable with your lawyer</h2>
            <p>Tax laws and tax liens are complicated areas of the law, and you want to make sure you are comfortable with your tax lawyer. A good first step is doing some research about different tax lawyers in your area. Make sure they have experience handling tax cases like yours or that they offer affordable payment plans if needed. You may even be able to find someone who has experience with your very specific type of case. For example, tax law is quite different than divorce law, so it's important to get an attorney who focuses on the area that applies to your needs.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: 400; color: #6198cb">Be aware of any fees or costs associated with hiring the attorney before signing anything</h2>
            <p>It can be difficult to find a tax lawyer in Mississippi, especially if you're looking for a competent one. You'll want to make sure they have experience with your specific issue and they're licensed to practice law. It's also important, to be honest, and upfront about your situation. The more information you can provide, the better. For example, if you're looking for someone to help you with tax debt or IRS issues, make sure they know this. This is just another piece of information an attorney will use when determining how best to take on your case and what steps they may need to take to reach a successful conclusion.</p>
